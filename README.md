# RaceAgainstTime
# Now or Never hackathon
We have made a basic chrome extension with timer in it. We were suppose to create an alarm on the basis of Average time, Minimum time and maximum time taken by different persons for solving the questions.
These three timer will run in the reverse order and on the completion of the the time, it will alert the user, this would increase the efficiency of the user.
For the creation of timer, basic HTML/CSS and JS is used .
For chrome extension, JS is used.
For the min, max and average time, we were trying to use to Firebase Database which is a free database provided by google.
